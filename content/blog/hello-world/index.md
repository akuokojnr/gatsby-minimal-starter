One of the profoundest inventions of the world which in my opinion is taken for granted is writing. The art of writing has not always been known to the sons of Adam and the daughters of Eve. It is believed that the written language emerged from the southernmost region of Mesopotamia, from a place called Sumer around c. 3500 -3000 BCE. This is the same region the biblical historian calls Shinar in the book of Genesis.

From carving symbols or sounds of words or phrases in caves, clay vessels and tablets to inscribing on parchments to this age of tweets and facebook posts, it is beyond argument that humans have indeed come a long way in their ability to express their thoughts and emotions in words that others can understand in exactitude.

Notwithstanding how commonplace writing might appear to be in the world today, the power of writing cannot be overemphasized. The phrase, 'words have power,' is almost a cliche. I will add that the written word is also powerful. In recognition of this truth, Muhammad remarked that <i>"the ink of a scholar is holier than the blood of a martyr."</i> The power of writing has been felt and will continue to be felt in the world as long as man breathes air.

The annals of history reveal the power and significance of writing throughout the ages. Talk about safeguarding rights and I will point you to the Magna Carta or the Emancipation Proclamation. Some individuals used the power of writing to advance unconventional and radical ideas which were considered heretical in their days. Galileo Galilei is one of the foremost of people of this class. Galileo posited ideas which were way ahead of his time through his writings and was reprimanded by the powers that were.

The power of writing as seen in a few of the instances cited above is truly remarkable. Yet, I am attracted to writing for another reason. The art of writing requires the discipline of the mind. To make the written piece worth the reader’s while, the writer must approach his sacred and immortal work with a singular purpose. Write haphazardly and you will lose the precious attention of your readers. For this reason, the writer is forced to cogitate on the ideas he wants to convey. Then, he must employ the most suitable words to present his ideas. Through such musings, he is challenged to find arguments to support the opinions which he wishes to present to the world.

That writing is an art in which inheres the responsibility to cogitate on one’s ideas and present them in a manner that would persuade or dissuade a person from a course of action, arouse or allay the passions or the curiosity of another, or perhaps, just to entertain the reader is what attracts me to writing. It is the reason why I have taken it up. It is the raison d'etre for this blog.

On this blog, I will share the musings of my solitary life on subjects that I feel strongly about. Instead of telling what is, I will endeavour to tell what can be or ought to be. I will question widely accepted beliefs across a number of disciplines. This I will endeavor to do by looking at things from a different perspective and by questioning the foundations of these strongly held beliefs. It will be one of the aims of this blog to advance unpopular ideas.
